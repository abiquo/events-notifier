1. Introduction

Python script that monitors Abiquo API and notifies new events through email based on rules.
Rules are stored in a SQLite database, which is queried by Notifier.

This script works with Abiquo 2.3 and Abiquo 2.4 API

2. Configuration

    * Install the required python libraries:
	python-dateutil   
	python-pycurl 
	pytz
 
    * Edit notifier.cfg and set correct values. More information at:
	http://wiki.abiquo.com/display/ABI23/Abiquo+Events+Notifier

    * Initialize rules database
        ./init_rules_db.py

3. Basic example

    * Create a rule that monitor VAPP_CREATE and VAPP_DELETE actions performed by user mmorata, and notify it to user sgirones. 
      Note that user sgirones must have a valid email.

        # ./add_rule.py --user sgirones --action VAPP_CREATE,VAPP_DELETE --owner mmorata

    * Verify rules are correctly created:

        # ./list_rules.py 

            --------------------------------------------------
            User: sgirones
            Actions: ['VAPP_CREATE', 'VAPP_DELETE']
            Owners: ['mmorata']
            --------------------------------------------------

    * Run the Events Notifier

        # ./main.py &
        
4. Rule's examples
        * Notify all users when their deploys/undeploys have finished:
            # ./add_rule.py -u all -a VAPP_POWERON,VAPP_POWEROFF

        * Notify cloud admin user all criticals:
            # ./add_rule.py -u sgirones -s CRITICAL
        
        
4. Final notes

    * Add rules while Notifier is running is ALLOWED. It will load rules every time it analizes events.
    * Valid actions are those listed by:
