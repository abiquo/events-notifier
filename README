##########################################

1. Introduction

Python script that monitors Abiquo API and notifies new events through email based on rules.
Rules are stored in a SQLite database, which is queried by Notifier.

2. Configuration

    * Install the required python libraries (rpmforge):
	- python-dateutil   
	- python-pycurl 
 
    * Edit notifier.cfg and set correct values.

3. Basic example

    * Init rules db

        # ./init_rules.py

    * Create a rule that monitor VAPP_CREATE and VAPP_DELETE actions performed by user mmorata, and notify it to user sgirones. Note that sgirones must have a valid email.

        # ./add_rule.py --user sgirones --action VAPP_CREATE,VAPP_DELETE --owner mmorata

    * Verify rules are correctly created:

        # ./list_rules.py 

            --------------------------------------------------
            User: sgirones
            Actions: ['VAPP_CREATE', 'VAPP_DELETE']
            Owners: ['mmorata']
            --------------------------------------------------

    * Run the Events Notifier

        # ./main.py &
        
4. Rule's examples
        * Notify all users when their deploys/undeploys have finished:
            # ./add_rule.py -u all -a VAPP_POWERON,VAPP_POWEROFF

        * Notify cloud admin user all criticals:
            # ./add_rule.py -u sgirones -s CRITICAL
